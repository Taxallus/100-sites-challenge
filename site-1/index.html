    <h1>I'm taxallus and welcome to my first site!</h1>
    <p>It's going to be a very simple site since I'm a novice at it.</p>
    <p><Strong>Okay.... Top 3 reasons why my videos sometimes come out late</Strong></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Such slow internet that I don't just want to make a video, I'm sad that I was born.</li>
    <li>A job that takes up my 90% of my time and energy and leaves me with no extra time and energy for creativity</li>
    <li>My learned helplessness syndrome that came from constant failed attempts and a banal lack of basic equipment from conservative parents who believe they will cause cancer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Yes, a little unoptimistic website business card turned out but it's mine and therefore reflects my inner state now.</p>
